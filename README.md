# Project Overview

This project contains two key Python files:

- **`llm.py`**: This file implements the core logic for interacting with a language model (LLM). It includes functions for generating text and managing model configurations.
- **`tools.py`**: This file provides utility functions and tools to support the main application. It includes helper methods for data preprocessing, logging, and other auxiliary tasks.

Both files work together to enable seamless integration and functionality for the project.
